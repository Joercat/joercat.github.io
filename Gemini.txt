That setup should be able to run a small, vanilla, or very lightly modded Minecraft server for 4 players (2 Bedrock, 2 Java) using GeyserMC, but you will likely face some performance limitations and a significant risk due to your storage setup.
Here's a breakdown of how your components will affect performance:
💻 CPU: Intel Core i3-2130
The i3-2130 is the biggest bottleneck in your setup.
 * Minecraft Server Nature: Minecraft's Java server is primarily single-threaded, meaning it relies heavily on the single-core performance of the CPU, not the number of cores. The i3-2130's single-core performance is quite old and relatively weak by modern standards.
 * 4 Players (Vanilla): For 4 players on a vanilla (unmodded) server, it should be adequate for basic exploration and building, but expect lag spikes when new chunks are generated, players are spread far apart, or complex Redstone/entity farms are active.
 * GeyserMC Overhead: GeyserMC acts as a translator, which adds a small but noticeable overhead to the server's CPU load as it converts network packets between the Java and Bedrock protocols. This will slightly increase the chances of lag, especially for the Bedrock players.
🧠 RAM: 16 GB DDR3
This is more than enough for your player count.
 * Requirement: For 4 players on a vanilla server, you would typically only need to allocate 2GB to 4GB of RAM to the server itself.
 * Total System RAM: Having 16GB total gives you plenty of headroom for the operating system and any other services running on the machine. You should be perfectly safe in this regard.
💾 Storage: 64 GB USB 2.0 Stick
This is a major point of failure and performance concern.
 * Speed: USB 2.0 is very slow (max theoretical throughput is 480 Mbps, but real-world transfer speeds are often <30 MB/s). Minecraft servers constantly read and write world data to disk (especially when loading new chunks), and this slow speed will cause significant lag and potentially even server crashes when the world is being accessed heavily.
 * Reliability/Lifespan: USB flash drives have a limited number of write cycles. Running a server from a flash drive, which involves constant reading and writing, will wear it out quickly and greatly shorten its lifespan, leading to data corruption and failure.
 * Recommendation: You must move the server files to a proper SATA Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or, ideally, a Solid State Drive (SSD) if you want reliable and smooth performance. Even a cheap, older SSD would be a massive improvement.
⚖️ Conclusion and Recommendations
You can run a Basic Survival or Lightly Modded server for 4 players, but you must take steps to mitigate the hardware weaknesses.
✅ What You Can Expect to Run
 * Vanilla Survival: Playable, but with occasional performance dips (TPS drops) during chunk generation and high-load events.
 * Optimized Server Software: You must use an optimized server jar like Paper, Spigot, or Purpur instead of the official Mojang server software. These include numerous performance enhancements that are critical for older CPUs.
 * Small World Size: You should limit the view distance in the server properties (e.g., to 6 or 8) to reduce the CPU's chunk processing load.
🛑 What You Should Avoid
 * Large, Complex Modpacks: Heavy modpacks will overwhelm the i3-2130.
 * High View Distance: Anything above 10 will strain the CPU and storage.
 * Running the server from the USB Stick: This is a performance bottleneck and a hardware time bomb.
